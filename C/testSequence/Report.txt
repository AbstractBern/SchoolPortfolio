Assignment 3:

Help: I did not have anyone help in the making of my code.

I believe I did do everything right up to what I have.
ALthough, I do not fully understand the address translation; However, this is ultimately my fault. In addition, the time I put in to this was minimal.

part1.c takes in a parameter of : a file to be read, and a file to be written to - in that order.

SO far, THe files are read and written to although; the address translation is missing.
