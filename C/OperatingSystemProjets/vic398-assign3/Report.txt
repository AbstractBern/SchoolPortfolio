1. Nobody helped me on this project.

2. I believe I did project one correctly. ALthough, I must be missing something
    on the second part I thnk I did the LRU incorrectly/ since the md5 sum is printing out
    different from your examples.
3. Challenges were finding where the program is implementing LRU incorrectly. I did not know how to 
        count page faults. but I understand the process on paper.

4. None;


Here are the MD5sums for both parts of the program. I was not able to do the EC.
