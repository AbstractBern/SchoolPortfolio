1. Collaborating Peers:
    I did not collaborate with anyone besides my findings on the internet and my own suggestions.

2. Correctness:
    I beleive that this assignment does what it needs to do. However, the approach may be non-traditional a bit.
3.    (if not)
        **I did not use valgrind due to my time spent testing and finding workable solutions.
        Additionally, I may have not done ReadFileLine appropriately.

4.  Comments:
    The challenges to this were not understanding C language, as a person who only studied C++; it is very difficult to grasp
    what the functions and built in libraries what they are capable of.

    I also understood more how to work my way around pointers and allocating data.
