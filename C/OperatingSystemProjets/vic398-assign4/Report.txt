1.  No one else worked on this assignment but me.


2.I do not think i did this program completely well.
    


3. I did implement a slection sort function although I had more problem splitting making a thread for another half of the array. Most of the problem was figuring out how to pass parameters to a function in a pthread_create. Or maybe im just not understanding the entire concept when pthread create uses function calling.


4. Be vocal about the many ways pthread can be used THe SGG book does not give too much info.
